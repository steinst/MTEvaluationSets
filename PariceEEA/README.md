## MT evaluation sets from the EEA subcorpus of Parice

These datasets are the same ones distributed in https://repository.clarin.is/repository/xmlui/handle/20.500.12537/146 with minor fixes.
These evaluation sets are created by extracting all sentences from a set of documents in the corpus. These documents are not a part of the compiled training sets. The sentences have been manually aligned and checked to be valid translations.
